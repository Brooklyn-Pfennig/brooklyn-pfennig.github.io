        <h3>My Essay on the History of Black and White Films <span id="show-hide">[hide]</span></h3>
        <p id="essay-section">There’s a number of people who don’t particularly appreciate or enjoy watching black-and-white films.
            They say the technology is too outdated, but fail to see how it was this technology that led to what is considered
            new technology in modern-day movies. Between editing, lighting, and technology, the process of film-making
            has evolved and changed since the first black-and-white silent films. But why do people not like black and 
            white movies? What factors play into the mindset that newer means better in the terms of movies?
        <br><br>
        One of the first moving pictures created, shortly after the discovery of motion photography, was titled
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jrB5ANUUY" target="_blank"><i>The Great Train Robbery</i></a>. It was made in the year 1903, by a man named Edwin S. Porter. The film itself is 
            twelve minutes long, with a plot detailing the first Western narrative ever made. Over the next twenty years, 
            silent films were produced, with different directors creating their own takes on different genres. They used 
            single-shot displays, ultimately taking photos one-by-one, then playing said photos in fast-motion, giving the 
            illusion of motion. Because of this, the average length of a frame in the 1930s was 12 seconds compared to 
            today’s 2.5. They also filmed in light-controlled studios, using lighting to put emphasis on the actors and sets

        The release of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018037/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4The" target="_blank"><i>The Jazz Singer (1927)</i></a>, which was the first ever talking film, brought a new cinematic 
            experience to people who had only been exposed to the silent film. “The 1930’s was considered the Golden Age of Hollywood. 
            A new era in film history began in this decade with the introduction of sound into film, creating new genres such as action, 
            musicals, documentaries, social statement films, comedies, westerns, and horror movies. The use of audio tracks in motion 
            pictures created a new view dynamic and also initiated Hollywood’s leverage in the upcoming World War II.”<a href="https://historycooperative.org/the-history-of-the-hollywood-movie-industry/" target="_blank">(Hale)</a>. 
            After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the film industry suffered a fallback, before bouncing back with new advances 
            such as special effects and improved sound quality.

        A classic for all ages, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>The Wizard of Oz (1939)</i></a> is also shot in black-and-white, till the moment Judy 
            Garland as Dorothy lands in Oz. At this moment in the film, the rest of the movie is in color, possibly 
            to catch the viewer’s eye and establish how different Oz is from the normal world that Dorothy is from. 
            This is what is considered the first full color film, however, some films created in the 1910s had been 
            colored using dye. It was, for a most part, unused, as dye was expensive and the process time-consuming. 
            “A U.S. company, Technicolor, was able to offer a process to easily project film with different filters 
            through projectors to create a new filming technique”<a href="https://thoughtco.com/how-movies-went-from-black-white-to-color-4153390" target="_blank">(McKittrick)</a>.

        Starting in the midst of the 1940s, the at-home television began replacing movie theaters. Despite having 
            been first successfully demonstrated in 1927, television did not become a common household item until 
            the 1950s. “No new invention entered American homes faster than black and white television sets; by 1955 
            half of all U.S. homes had one” <a href="https://nyu.edu/classes/stephens/History%20of%20Television%20page.htm
            industry/" target="_blank">(Stephens)</a>. This sudden boom in television sales caused many cinemas and 
            movie theaters to shut down. Hollywood studios soon saw the need to create films for TV, to make back the 
            money that was being lost in the cinema.

        “The 1970s saw a revival of traits of the Golden Age films. Called the ‘post-classical’ era, films from 
            this decade were characterized by shady protagonists, endings with a twist and flashbacks.” <a href="https://internationalstudent.com/study-film/history-of-film/" target="_blank">(“History of Film”)</a> 
            The films that used CGI, such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>Star Wars</i></a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070909/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3" target="_blank"><i>Westworld</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074559/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>Futureworld</i></a>, all became stepping stones to movies 
            like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>Jurassic Park</i></a> (first photo realistic computer-generated creatures) and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>Toy Story</i></a> (first fully CGI 
            animated movie). “As we entered the 21st century the possibilities for CGI became almost endless, with 
            computer-generated imagery becoming more and more a part of authentic film footage. Movies like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>The Lord 
            of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)</i></a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3" target="_blank"><i>The Matrix: Reloaded (2003)</i></a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338348/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>The Polar Express (2004)</i></a> 
            are good examples of that development” <a href="https://computerstories.net/a-computer-generated-imagery-cgi-history-698" target="_blank">(Gonzalez)</a>.

        From the first movie to use hand-drawn animation, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029583/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_5" target="_blank"><i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)</i></a>, to one of the 
            latest in animation technology, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5848272/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018</i>)</a>, which uses computer animation, even 
            the process of animation has changed. It is likely that the process of hand-drawing animation is becoming 
            obsolete in big animation companies. The reason two-dimensional animation in the film industry has been 
            in decline is that people have just gotten used to such high-quality complex rendering from the films 
            they watch, it’s hard to go back.
        <br><br>
        Movies now are created to distract our brains for a short while. Due to the lack of color in a black-and-white 
            film, our brain must fill it in, which trumps our will to be distracted. In general, older movies aren’t 
            favored by people with shorter attention spans than most. They also believe that older films lack quality, 
            and sometimes the actors are terrible. However, films such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3" target="_blank"><i>Psycho (1960)</i></a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038650/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0" target="_blank"><i>It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)</i></a> 
            have withstood the test of time, as they are still deemed as classic cinema, despite a longer frame rate 
            throughout, and less stimulating and colorful appeal. 
        <br><br>
        The future of film itself is something entirely different from its beginning. It is likely, with the 
            invention of smart phones and the installation of IMAX screens, that the movie industry will be taking 
            the digital route. Gone are the days of the antique film reels. Now it is a digital projection in the popular cinemas. 
        <br><br>
        The subject of film-making and the concept of color could be continued, and further points could be 
        presented about it. The ideas are the same, yet the process have evolved. From more hands-on production to 
        computer technology, film has been revolutionized again and again with new discoveries so that one can further 
        lose themselves in the screen. Technology can never go back. It is hard to convince people to see a movie that 
        isn’t the newest in editing, lighting, and technology. Once one has seen the fast-paced, stimulating, high-quality 
        films of today, it is hard to go back to the simplicity of movies from the past.
